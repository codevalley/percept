# Backwave

Backwave is a web application designed to help individuals improve their self-awareness by collecting anonymous feedback from their peers. This repository contains both the backend API implemented using Flask and MongoDB, and the frontend implemented in Vue.js.

## Features

- Create surveys with customizable questions
- Collect anonymous responses
- Calculate deviations and aggregated results
- Export survey data

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Setup and Running the Application

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/codevalley/percept.git
   cd percept
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your MongoDB URI:
   ```
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/percept
   ```

3. Build and start the Docker containers:
   ```
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This command will build the images for the backend, frontend, and set up the MongoDB database. It will then start all the services.

4. The application will be available at:
   - Frontend: http://localhost
   - Backend API: http://localhost/api

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. Backend changes:
   - Modify the Flask app files as needed.
   - Rebuild and restart the containers:
     ```
     docker-compose down
     docker-compose up --build
     ```

2. Frontend changes:
   - Modify the Vue.js app files in the `webapp` directory.
   - Rebuild and restart the containers:
     ```
     docker-compose down
     docker-compose up --build
     ```

3. To run the containers in detached mode:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. To view logs:
   ```
   docker-compose logs
   ```
   Or for a specific service:
   ```
   docker-compose logs backend
   ```

### Running Tests

To run the unit tests:

```
docker-compose run --rm backend python -m unittest test_survey_results.py
```

## Using the API

Here are some example curl commands to interact with the API:

1. Create a new survey:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost/api/v1/surveys \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{
          "title": "My Survey",
          "questions": [
            {
              "text": "How do you feel?",
              "response_type": "scale",
              "response_scale_max": 5,
              "creator_answer": 4
            }
          ]
        }'
   ```
   Response:
   ```json
   {
     "survey_id": 1719295638748,
     "share_link": "/surveys/1719295638748",
     "user_code": 1719295638749,
     "questions": [
       {"id": 1, "text": "How do you feel?"}
     ]
   }
   ```

2. Retrieve a survey (replace {survey_id} with the ID from the create response):
   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://localhost/api/v1/surveys/{survey_id}
   ```

3. Submit answers to a survey:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost/api/v1/surveys/{survey_id}/answers \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{
          "answers": [
            {
              "question_id": 1,
              "answer": 4
            }
          ]
        }'
   ```

Replace `{survey_id}` with the actual survey ID from your created survey.


## API Endpoints

For detailed API documentation, refer to the [api_endpoints.md](api_endpoints.md) file.

## Troubleshooting

1. If you encounter CORS issues:
   - Check the CORS configuration in `app.py` and ensure it matches your frontend URL.
   - Verify that the Nginx configuration in `nginx.conf` is correctly set up to handle CORS headers.

2. If services fail to start:
   - Check the Docker logs for each service:
     ```
     docker-compose logs [service_name]
     ```
   - Ensure all required environment variables are set in the `.env` file.

3. If changes are not reflecting:
   - Ensure you've rebuilt the Docker images after making changes:
     ```
     docker-compose down
     docker-compose up --build
     ```

4. If you're experiencing database connection issues:
   - Verify that the MongoDB container is running:
     ```
     docker-compose ps
     ```
   - Check the MongoDB logs:
     ```
     docker-compose logs mongo
     ```
   - Ensure the `MONGO_URI` in the `.env` file is correct.

5. To reset the entire setup:
   ```
   docker-compose down -v
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   Note: This will remove all data in the MongoDB volume.
